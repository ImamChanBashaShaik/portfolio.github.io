            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> <em>FLEXIBLE AND EFFECTIVE IDS TO DETECT CYBER ATTACKS</em> - The project aims to enhance intrusion detection systems (IDS) 
                    by leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately classify and detect cyber attacks. 
                    By utilizing the NSL-KDD dataset, the project evaluates the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
                    Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to improve detection accuracy and minimize false positives 
                    and negatives. The primary goal is to develop a robust IDS that offers high accuracy in identifying and 
                    differentiating between malicious and benign network traffic, thereby strengthening cybersecurity defenses.</li>
